# Chicago Bikeshare Analysis
In this project, I analysed and visualized **299980** rows of data in a table that contains the chicago bikeshare data from January to June 2017. The chicago bikeshare company provides a bike-sharing service, allowing individuals to rent bikes for short periods. Users can pick up and drop off bikes at designated stations throughout the city.
